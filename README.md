# Chair Loot Box Game!

Welcome. The Objective of this Game is to open Loot Boxes which contain different types of chairs. In this Game you don't spend real money, but an in-game Currency you get from playing a Spaceship surviving game. The Longer you Survive and more Chair Aliens you Kill, the more money you get to spend on loot boxes. Every time you die, your loot box money is saved and if you are willing to spend it on the loot box, you will get a random chair. (some chairs like the Metal Chair and Plastic Chair are more common and the King Chair or Barber Chairs are more Rare.) You can then click on the Chair Collection button and it will show all the unique chairs you have gotten. 

# Chair Invaders
Swiping left on the main Screen will take you to the Spaceship Surviver Game. (Chair Invaders). If you hook up your phone you should be able to tilt the spaceship left and right by tilting the phone left and right. In the Simulator you can use the mouse to point to a specific spot and the spaceship will follow. To fire shots at the Chair Invaders touch or click. If you get hit once you will die and you can restart by pressing the restart text. The Longer your survive different patterns of enemies will show up, with different speeds and spawn rates. This was my take on trying to make the gam harder as it progresses. This is refered to as Default Mode.

# Game Config
While on the Main Screen you can push the settings button which will take you to a game config for the chair Invaders game.

Chair Animation Speed changes how fast the Chairs go across the speed. Chair Spawn Rate
