# Chair Loot Box Game!

Welcome. The Objective of this Game is to open Loot Boxes which contain different types of chairs. In this Game you don't spend real money, but an in-game Currency you get from playing a Spaceship surviving game. The Longer you Survive and more Chair Aliens you Kill, the more money you get to spend on loot boxes. Every time you die, your loot box money is saved and if you are willing to spend it on the loot box, you will get a random chair. (some chairs like the Metal Chair and Plastic Chair are more common and the King Chair or Barber Chairs are more Rare.) You can then click on the Chair Collection button and it will show all the unique chairs you have gotten.
